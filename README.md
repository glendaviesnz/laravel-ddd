laravel-ddd
===========

N.B. I am not doing Laravel development currently, so this will not receive much love in the near future - but will leave it here for historical purposes ...

A sandpit for playing around with DDD architecture options in Laravel 4.

Gives a basic folder structure as a suggested approach, along with simple integration of Doctrine ORM. 

This is provided as a companion to some blog posts at 

http://caughtexceptions.blogspot.co.nz/2014/02/domain-driven-design-in-laravel-4-part-1.html

It is not intended to be production code, and will not be developed past its current form in the near future.

If you have put together a working architecture of Laravel 4, Doctrine and good DDD principles, let me know and I will put a link to it from here.
